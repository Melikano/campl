This folder contains some more significant examples of some MPL programs.

## Tic tac toe
A classical tic tac toe game meant to be played by two different players.

Remarks.
- This uses a memory cell to pass the game state between the two players

TODO: Automatic player to replace the person (do this in checkers later too sometime)
    some modularity with the program. 

## Halma
A four player game where players try to get all their pieces to the other side..

Remarks.
- This generalizes the memory cell for four players. 

## Message board
As simple message board for people to dump messages on. The idea is as follows:

- two terminals open up, and

- each of the terminals may dump messages (without doing a get/put wait on each
  other) on the original console.

Remarks.
- This uses a race and the id command to allow both parties to dump stuff the
  the same terminal


TODO:
## Reaction based games...

### Typing test

### Snap
    - (TODO: need random then..)
    - deal out a whole bunch of cards... 
    - If you both turn over the same face card, then first person to call snap doesn't hvae to pick up the card.
    - objective: get rid of all cards..
