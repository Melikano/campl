The new 'on' syntax is a macro that allows for a channel name to be specified once, and used multiple times.

For example:

	on channelName do
		get a
		put a + 3
		hput Listener

Is equivalent to:

	get a on channelName
	put a + 3 on channelName
	hput Listener on channelName

'on channel do' is a process command, and can be used anywhere process commands are used.
The 'on' block is automatically converted to a regular sequence of commands prior
to other forms of AST traversal, so any non-parser errors related to 'on' blocks will
display the sub-commands in their expanded forms.
The valid sub-commands to be used within an 'on' block are as follows:

    get <pattern>
    put <value>
    hput <handle>
    hcase of
        <handle> -> procBody
        ...
        <handle> -> procBody
    fork as
        <name1> -> procBody
        <name2> -> procBody
    split into <name1>,<name2>
    close
    halt
